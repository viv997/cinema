                        <h4>Kireedam</h4>
                        <p>The film chronicles the life of a young man whose life turns upside down when he intervenes in a dispute to rescue his father (a cop) from a ruthless local outlaw. An inadvertent moment of rage and the series of unanticipated repercussions that follow it form the poignant focus of this Malayalam classic.</p>

                        <h4>Thaniyavarthanam</h4>
                        <p>This was the first film that kicked off the Malayil-Lohithadas partnership. The film discusses a variety of topics such as superstition and orthodoxy in rural Kerala, attitudes towards mental illness, the difference of attitudes between people of different generations, and the decline of once-proud Nair “joint families”.</p>

                        <p>Vadakkunokkiyantram’ is one of the finest dark comedies in Indian cinema. Sreenivasan’s insightful observations on the male ego, insecurities, and inferiority complex shine through in his performance as well as direction.</p>

                        <h4>Vaanaprastham</h4>
                        <p>‘Vanaprastham’ is the crowning glory in Mohanlal’s acting career for which he won yet another National Award. His tragic performance is considered the pinnacle of acting by many. The film chronicles the life of a lower-caste Kathakali artist (Mohanlal) who receives great acclaim in his career but is burdened by repeated rejections and abandonment in his personal life.</p>
